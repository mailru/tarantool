-- test-run result file version 2
-- In this test we are attempting at simulating following scenario:
-- inside transaction execute such first operation which won't get into
-- tx log, but will get into tx writers list. Verify that the next operation
-- in the same transaction won't be added to tx writers list again (otherwise
-- it will break writers list itself since it doesn't tolerate adding the
-- same entry twice). As verification of writers list integrity we switch
-- read_only mode which assumes iteration over mentioned list.
