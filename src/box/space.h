/**
 * @brief A single method to handle REPLACE, DELETE and UPDATE.
 *
 * @param sp space
 * @param old_tuple the tuple that should be removed (can be NULL)
 * @param new_tuple the tuple that should be inserted (can be NULL)
 * @param mode      dup_replace_mode, used only if new_tuple is not
 *                  NULL and old_tuple is NULL, and only for the
 *                  primary key.
 *
 * For DELETE, new_tuple must be NULL. old_tuple must be
 * previously found in the primary key.
 *
 * For REPLACE, old_tuple must be NULL. The additional
 * argument dup_replace_mode further defines how REPLACE
 * should proceed.
 *
 * For UPDATE, both old_tuple and new_tuple must be given,
 * where old_tuple must be previously found in the primary key.
 *
 * Let's consider these three cases in detail:
 *
 * 1. DELETE, old_tuple is not NULL, new_tuple is NULL
 *    The effect is that old_tuple is removed from all
 *    indexes. dup_replace_mode is ignored.
 *
 * 2. REPLACE, old_tuple is NULL, new_tuple is not NULL,
 *    has one simple sub-case and two with further
 *    ramifications:
 *
 *	A. dup_replace_mode is DUP_INSERT. Attempts to insert the
 *	new tuple into all indexes. If *any* of the unique indexes
 *	has a duplicate key, deletion is aborted, all of its
 *	effects are removed, and an error is thrown.
 *
 *	B. dup_replace_mode is DUP_REPLACE. It means an existing
 *	tuple has to be replaced with the new one. To do it, tries
 *	to find a tuple with a duplicate key in the primary index.
 *	If the tuple is not found, throws an error. Otherwise,
 *	replaces the old tuple with a new one in the primary key.
 *	Continues on to secondary keys, but if there is any
 *	secondary key, which has a duplicate tuple, but one which
 *	is different from the duplicate found in the primary key,
 *	aborts, puts everything back, throws an exception.
 *
 *	For example, if there is a space with 3 unique keys and
 *	two tuples { 1, 2, 3 } and { 3, 1, 2 }:
 *
 *	This REPLACE/DUP_REPLACE is OK: { 1, 5, 5 }
 *	This REPLACE/DUP_REPLACE is not OK: { 2, 2, 2 } (there
 *	is no tuple with key '2' in the primary key)
 *	This REPLACE/DUP_REPLACE is not OK: { 1, 1, 1 } (there
 *	is a conflicting tuple in the secondary unique key).
 *
 *	C. dup_replace_mode is DUP_REPLACE_OR_INSERT. If
 *	there is a duplicate tuple in the primary key, behaves the
 *	same way as DUP_REPLACE, otherwise behaves the same way as
 *	DUP_INSERT.
 *
 * 3. UPDATE has to delete the old tuple and insert a new one.
 *    dup_replace_mode is ignored.
 *    Note that old_tuple primary key doesn't have to match
 *    new_tuple primary key, thus a duplicate can be found.
 *    For this reason, and since there can be duplicates in
 *    other indexes, UPDATE is the same as DELETE +
 *    REPLACE/DUP_INSERT.
 *
 * @return old_tuple. DELETE, UPDATE and REPLACE/DUP_REPLACE
 * always produce an old tuple. REPLACE/DUP_INSERT always returns
 * NULL. REPLACE/DUP_REPLACE_OR_INSERT may or may not find
 * a duplicate.
 *
 * The method is all-or-nothing in all cases. Changes are either
 * applied to all indexes, or nothing applied at all.
 *
 * Note, that even in case of REPLACE, dup_replace_mode only
 * affects the primary key, for secondary keys it's always
 * DUP_INSERT.
 *
 * @return tuple that was removed from the space.
 *         The call never removes more than one tuple: if
 *         old_tuple is given, dup_replace_mode is ignored.
 *         Otherwise, it's taken into account only for the
 *         primary key.
