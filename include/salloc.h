 * (e.g. BITSET) have better performance then they operate on sequencial
 * offsets (i.e. dense space) instead of memory pointers (sparse space).
 *
 * The calculation is based on SLAB number and the position of an item within
 * it. Current implementation only guarantees that adjacent chunks from one
 * SLAB will have consecutive indexes. That is, if two chunks were sequencially
 * allocated from one chunk they will have sequencial ids. If a second chunk was
 * allocated from another SLAB th–µn the difference between indexes may be more
 * then one.
