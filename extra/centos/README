This init scripts are tested under CentOS 6
They are likely to work under other versions of CentOS

There are two services provided: tarantool and tarantool-watch

### tarantool
  This service is able to launch many tarantool instances at once, as 
  well as to manage single tarantool instance.

  To add intance one should place configuration file (or a link to it)
  under /etc/tarantool/instances.enabled directory, naming it in the following
  format:
    tarantool_<instance name>.cfg
  For example, to add instance named 'foobar', create a file
  /etc/tarantool/instances.enabled/tarantool_foobar.cfg

  There are some options which should present in every configuraton file
  managed by this service, otherwise an instance will not tried to start:

    *  work_dir
    *  username
    *  logger
    *  pid_file

  Usage examples:

  service tarantool start   - Start all available instances
  service tarantool stop    - Stop all available instances
  service tarantool restart - Stop and then start every available instance
  service tarantool status  - Show status information for every instance

  service tarantool -i foobar start - Start only instance named foobar
  service tarantool -i foobar init - In case if tarantool storage has not
    been created previewsly, call tarantool_box with --init-storage 
    parameter

  service tarantool list    - list every instance name

### tarantool-watch
  This service is a watchdog for tarantool instances, managed by tarantool 
  service. It is started in background and monitors all available instances
  (as returned by service tarantool list) for their status ( by caling 
  service tarantool -i <instance> status) with configurable time interval 
  (defaults to two seconds). Should the instance die unexpectedly,
  tarantool-watch will restart it.

  It is possible to make tarantool-watch only monitor specified instances 
  by editing /etc/sysconfig/tarantool-watch file, adding string like this:

    WATCH_INSTANCE_LIST='instance1 instance2'

  Only instance1 and instance2 will be monitored and automatically restarted
  with the last example. 

  Other useful settings are available via /etc/sysconfig/tarantool-watch,
  such as logging via syslog. See provided example for details.

### BUGS AND KNOWN ISSUES

  It is not currently possible to tell if tarantool instance started 
  correctly, so 'service tarantool start' will report OK for every instance.
  instance itself may die some (often very short) time after it starts,
  for example if it is not able to bind to configured address and/or port.
